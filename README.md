# odin-recipes
This is my repo for recipes
-In this project I created a website that teaches one how to make three different meals
-I used HTML 5 to create the website.
-Within the project I displayed my understanding of different HTML elements
-I used elements such as <P>, <h1>, <h2>, and <h4> elements
-I also displayed my knowledge of how to use unordered and ordered lists
-Furthermore I used "a href" and "img" elements as well
